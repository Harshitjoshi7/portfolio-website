# Harshit Joshi - Personal Portfolio

A sleek, modern, and responsive single-page personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as an Electronics & Communication Engineering student.

## ✨ Features

- **Modern UI/UX**: Dark theme aesthetics with vibrant cyan and purple neon accents.
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Subtle translucent backgrounds with background blur for a premium look.
- **Interactive Animations**: CSS micro-animations, a fluid morphing profile image, and a dynamic typing text effect.
- **Fully Responsive**: Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) with a custom mobile hamburger navigation.
- **Single File Structure**: Easy to deploy and modify—everything (HTML, CSS, JS) is contained within a single `index.html` file.
- **Icon Integration**: Utilizes Font Awesome icons for visual clarity.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Vanilla CSS with custom properties (`:root` variables), modern grid/flexbox layouts, keyframe animations, and glassmorphism styling.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Handles the typing effect, scroll animations (Intersection Observer), and mobile navigation toggle.
- **Google Fonts**: 'Outfit' for headings and 'Inter' for body text.

## 🚀 Sections Included

1.  **Hero/Home**: Name, dynamic roles, introductory bio, and profile image.
2.  **About & Education**: Academic background at SISTec and personal journey.
3.  **Skills**: Categorized technical skills (Programming, Embedded & IoT, Tools & Platforms).
4.  **Projects**: Project cards highlighting features and tech stacks (e.g., Brian-AI, Law-GPT).
5.  **Experience & Extras**: Campus Ambassador roles and extracurricular activities.
6.  **Contact**: Links to Email, Phone, and LinkedIn.

## 💻 How to Run Locally

Since this is a static single-page application and does not require a build step or external dependencies (other than CDNs for fonts/icons):

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Ensure you have the profile image (`Gemini_Generated_Image_w4cduyw4cduyw4cd.png`) in the same directory.
3.  Simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.

*Alternatively, you can run a local development server to test it:*

```bash
# If you have Python installed, you can use:
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a 3rd-year B.Tech student at Sagar Institute of Science & Technology (SISTec), Bhopal. My technical journey bridges the gap between hardware and software, with hands-on experience in microcontroller programming, real-time system design, and AI integration.
